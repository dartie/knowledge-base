# Electron

## What is electron.js?
Electron is an open source framework that lets developers build cross-platform applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. One of the main advantage of using electron is that it can be used on all operating systems, including Linux. The main downside of electron apps is that sometimes they use high memory, CPU and disk space.

Electron uses a Node.js runtime for the back-end part and Chromium for the front-end. Each electron app run its own chromium instance. Thatâ€™s why these apps take up more memory and CPU in your PC.

Nowadays computers have higher processing power and high memory capacities therefore the above-mentioned downside will not be a huge problem anymore.
