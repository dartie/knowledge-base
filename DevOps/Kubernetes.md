# Kubernetes
Open-source container orchestration system for automating software deployment, scaling, and management. 
* Originally designed by Google, the project is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. 
* The name Kubernetes originates from Ancient Greek, meaning 'helmsman' or 'pilot'.
* Also written as `K8S` where `8` is the number of letters omitted. 

## Implementations
* [k8s](https://kubernetes.io/)
* [k3s](https://k3s.io)
* [minikube (Canonical)](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io)
* [microk8s](https://microk8s.io/)
* [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) : runs local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container “nodes”.  `kind` was primarily designed for testing Kubernetes itself, but may be used for local development or CI.

# Minikube
Def:

Since minikube is installed on your own computer, it lacks the security controls offered by a cloud provider.
